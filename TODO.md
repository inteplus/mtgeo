    - A geometry object that is an intersection of a set of geometry objects can inherit from any element of the set. But there should be a function to convert objects of other geometry of the set to the intersection representation.
    - Implement circle, sphere and hypersphere.
    - Implement square, cube and hypercube.
    - Unify the intersect and union interface. Right now it's ugly.
    - miniball.py exists, miniball.cpp exists. But only use them when the demand for them is non-zero.
    - How to import polygon_integral.py automatically if both polygon.py or moments.py are imported?
