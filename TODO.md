    - View the world as a set of geometry objects, can be 2D or 3D or ND, point set, circle, ellipse, box, rectangle, parallelogram, etc.
    - View tranformer as an object that turns a geometry object to another geometry object.
    - A geometry object that is an intersection of a set of geometry objects can inherit from any element of the set. But there should be a function to convert objects of other geometry of the set to the intersection representation.
